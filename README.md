# THE MAIN WEBSITE FOR ARTSNL

This codebase acts as the main website for ARTSNL, the brand.

Currently, ARTSNL is split up between two separate URLs:

- [Main website](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for front-end tooling.
- [App](https://artsnl.app/) which can be audited at its codebase [here](https://github.com/ECBSJ/ARTSNL)
